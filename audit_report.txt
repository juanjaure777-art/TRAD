3. DECISIONES GATEKEEPER (últimas 5)
[2025-12-01 23:55:53] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 36.4 near oversold but NEUTRAL phase with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires trending phase confirmation and RSI<35 for entry. Current setup lacks directional conviction despite good R:R 1:2.5
[2025-12-01 23:57:43] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 35.2 near oversold but NEUTRAL phase lacks directional conviction. Level 2 requires trending phase confirmation. Volatility normal but without trend alignment, setup is weak despite good R:R 1:2.5
[2025-12-01 23:58:04] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 34.8 near oversold but NEUTRAL phase with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires alignment confirmation - current setup lacks directional clarity. Wait for trending phase or RSI<30 for better entry
[2025-12-01 23:59:53] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 34.3 approaching oversold but still above Level 2 threshold (<35). NEUTRAL phase with bearish EMA structure (128<132) suggests unclear direction. Need RSI <35 or stronger trend alignment for Level 2 entry
[2025-12-02 00:00:13] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 34.5 near oversold but Phase NEUTRAL with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires RSI<35 with trending confirmation, not neutral phase. Volatility normal but no clear directional alignment
[2025-12-02 00:02:03] REJECTED | Conf: 0.35 | RSI 34 near oversold but Phase NEUTRAL with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires RSI<35 with trend confirmation - current setup lacks directional conviction. Volatility normal but no clear trend alignment.
[2025-12-02 00:02:22] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | RSI 33.6 near oversold but Phase NEUTRAL with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires RSI<35 with trending confirmation - current NEUTRAL phase insufficient. Need clearer trend alignment for entry.
[2025-12-02 00:04:11] REJECTED | Conf: 0.30 | Level 2 requires RSI < 35 but RSI is 34.0 (borderline). Phase is NEUTRAL not trending. EMA 128 < 132 shows bearish structure but not confirmed trend. Need clearer directional signal or RSI < 30 for neutral phase entry.
[2025-12-02 00:04:32] REJECTED | Conf: 0.35 | RSI 34.2 near oversold but NEUTRAL phase with bearish EMA structure (128<132). Level 2 requires RSI<35 with trend alignment - current setup lacks directional conviction. Volatility normal but momentum neutral (47% HH vs 37% LL) suggests choppy conditions
[2025-12-02 00:07:41] APPROVED | Conf: 0.85 | Confidence 0.85: Alignment 85%, MTF Direction BEARISH confirmed, RSI 32.7 in oversold range (30-35) for short entry, R:R 1:2.5 exceeds Level 2 requirement (1:1.5). Despite EXTREME_VOLATILITY risk flag on daily, current volatility NORMAL at 1.67% allows entry with strong MTF alignment
